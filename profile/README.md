# 👋 Hello from Mi-One Brands!

Welcome to the official GitHub Organization for **Mi-One Brands** — a Phoenix-based distributor of vape and tobacco products. We operate a broad network of websites and platforms including retail storefronts, wholesale distribution portals, and advocacy initiatives focused on education, compliance, and accessibility in the industry.

## 🚀 What We Do

Mi-One Brands is more than just distribution. We build and support powerful tools for:

- 🛒 **Retail & Wholesale Operations** (via Shopify)
- 📦 **Inventory, Orders & Logistics** (via Microsoft Business Central)
- 🔒 **Regulatory Compliance** (Shipping restrictions, tax calculation, and banned product management)
- 📊 **Custom Business Intelligence** for data-driven decision making
- 🧾 **Checkout & Rate Systems** powered by real-time rules and logic
- 💡 **Internal Applications** that support warehouse workflows, marketing ops, and cross-platform integrations

We believe in **automation**, **clarity**, and **compliance** — delivering tools that allow our business and advocacy arms to scale responsibly.

## 👩‍💻 For Developers

We maintain open and internal repositories that:

- Power microservices built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **React**, and **MongoDB**
- Integrate with external APIs like **Shopify GraphQL Admin**, **Avalara**, and **Microsoft Dynamics 365 BC**

If you're working on solutions around **eCommerce**, **ERP**, or **regulated industries**, our codebase might be a helpful reference.
